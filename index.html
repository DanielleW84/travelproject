          <h2>WHY LONDON?</h2>
          <h3>London, the City of Seven Hills</h3>
          <p>
            Though not as famous as Rome's seven hills, London is often referred
            to as the "City of Seven Hills," a title that evokes the city's rich
            history and varied topography. Like Rome, London is built upon
            several elevated areas that have shaped the city's development over
            time. While the exact number of hills is debated, there are many
            notable rises in the landscape that have been part of London's story
            since its Roman days.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some of the hills traditionally linked to London's iconic landscape
            include Parliament Hill in Hampstead Heath, Primrose Hill near
            Regent's Park, and Shooter's Hill in Southeast London. These hills,
            along with others like Highgate Hill and Sydenham Hill, not only
            offer breathtaking views of the sprawling city but also provide
            insight into London's ancient past, when the Romans chose elevated
            ground to build their settlement, Londinium.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, while the hills themselves are not as prominent as they once
            were, they still offer a glimpse of the city's ancient geography,
            where the blend of urban development and nature creates a unique
            sense of place. Whether you're standing on one of these hills or
            strolling through the vibrant streets below, London's hills remind
            us of the deep historical layers that define this magnificent city.
